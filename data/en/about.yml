    title : Books
    content : At a very young age, I liked books a lot. Soon, I liked books so much that I wanted to write my own book. So then I asked my mom if I could borrow her laptop and write my own book. She agreed. Then began the writing of my first book. Almost 4 years later, I got an opportunity to publish my book. I wrote a book which was supposed to be published. You can read both my books by clicking [here](/#services).

    title : Cooking
    content : From the age of 5, I have been cooking. My first competition for cooking was at Forum Neighborhood Mall, Whitefield. The Chef Champ was a competition which was a championship for kids under 7. I participated in it. I didn't win, but I enjoyed and learnt some amazing recipes. Later, when I was 8, the COVID-19 pandemic began. At that time, we were forced to stay at home. As I was bored, I began to cook dishes. I followed many videos and made dishes which my family found amazing. Now, I've posted my own recipes on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCgd1EtE_EUEyI-n-YuVvrOg).

    title: Programming
    content: When I was 6, I started doing Bubble. After a while, a seminar was conducted. I got permission to participate in it. I made it about Bubble. My photo was then posted on Twitter. A few years later, when I was 7 years, I created a program in Java for Tic Tac Toe. When I was 8, my mother started teaching me Python Programming. After her classes, I was able to create a Hangman program in Python fully by myself. Soon after, my mother developed a website. I was so interested in it that I created a copy and developed some more content. My mother liked it a lot.

    content: I've taken a fancy to web development since I saw my parents building websites. Since then I've liked it so much that it inspired me to make my own websites as well.
